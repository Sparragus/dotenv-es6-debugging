dotenv-es6
==========

This repo contains different branches. Each branch shows an alternative to loading env variables using dotenv. Not all branches have a working version, and that's done on purpose.

Please checkout each branch and refer to the README.md for details.

## branch: master
This branch uses babel-node to execute ES6 code. It loads .env by importing `dotenv/config`.

This app works.
